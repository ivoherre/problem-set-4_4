# Problem Set 4-4

## Closures, Prototypes, Constructors, and Classes

1. What is a closure?
Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of it's outer function, even after the outer function has returned.

2. What are the benefits of using a constructor functions to create object instances instead of a factory function?
One benefit of using  constructor functions to create object instances instead of a factory function are that syntax involved makes code easier to comprehend.Another benefit is being able to use `__proto__` and `.protoype` & also inherit properties from the constructor's protoype property.

3. What is the `__proto__` property and how does it differ from the `protoype` property?
I know that `__proto__` could be in prototype but prototype can't be in `__proto__`. In prototype the objects are in constructor function and `__proto__` property of objects (instances of a constructor.)
